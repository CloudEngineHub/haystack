    The Pipeline API has been enhanced to handle crashes and resume state. This means that if a pipeline execution is
    interrupted due to a crash or failure, it can now be resumed from the last successful state rather than starting
    over from the beginning. This improvement increases the reliability and efficiency of pipeline executions,
    especially for long-running processes.
