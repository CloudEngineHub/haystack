    We are announcing that Haystack 1.26 is the final minor release for Haystack 1.x.
    Although we will continue to release bug fixes for this version, we will neither
    be adding nor removing any functionalities. Instead, we will focus our efforts on
    Haystack 2.x. Haystack 1.26 will reach its end-of-life on March 11, 2025.
